## Fabric - 1.20.1

Inspired by popular medias such as Ark:SE, Jurassic Park, and my own love of Dinosaurs and prehistory!

**_I use the term "Dinosaur" quite loosely, as really these are just prehistoric creatures; Theropods, Pterosaurs, Invertebrates, and Fishes, but I hope you enjoy them!_**

This mod will add 9 naturally spawning Animals to the Overworld, that can be ridden, used as food or resources, breed, and interact with other entities. Further details can be found on the [Wiki](https://github.com/NecroCrab/dinos-1.20.1/wiki).
